## Why I Built It

When doing web development, there are so many things to check before deployment. Are the OGP tags correct? Will the emails send? Is the performance acceptable? I got tired of opening different tools every time.

So I figured — why not build an all-in-one tool? That's how DevCheck started.

## Tech Choices

I chose Electron because I wanted everything to run locally. No cloud dependency.

- **Electron + React + TypeScript** — React for UI, TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** — Fast HMR even in Electron
- **Tailwind CSS** — The only styling choice
- **Zustand** — Lightweight state management

## The Hard Parts

The SMTP test server was the trickiest part. I used the Node.js `smtp-server` package, but getting real-time email display working through Electron's IPC between main and renderer processes took some creative engineering.

The solution: run the SMTP server in the main process and notify the renderer via IPC on each email received.

## What I Learned

"All-in-one" tools are fun but scope management matters. I started with 10 features but trimmed down to 7. Shipping beats perfection.
